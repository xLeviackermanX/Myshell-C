#COMMAND THAT I IMPLEMENTED:-

1. cd command with your code directory being home directory for shell
2. echo, pwd , ls (with flags l and a)
3. pipeline
4. redirection
5. pinfo <pid> (finds info about a process with given pid)
6. jobs
7. kjob (send signals to a process)
8. fg
9. bg
10.overkill (kill our background process)
11.valid command which runs in your bash terminal also with option of running in foreground or background if used with "&"
12.Signal handlers like shell will exit on ctrl+d , process can be stopped using ctrl+c and foreground process will get into sleep mode on using ctrl+z. 

>>>MAKEFILE IS MADE FOR COMPILING ALL THE CODES WHICH IS STORED IN DIRECTORY OF SHELL CODES. 
   SO TO COMPILE CODE JUST GO TO THE WORKING DIRECTORY OF SHELL CODES AND WRITE MAKE COMMAND IN THE TERMINAL.
